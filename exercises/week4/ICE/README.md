Write a program using C to take the length (L) and width (W) of a rectangle from the user to calculate the perimeter and the area of the rectangle.

This program should contains three functions: 
	- area (L, W) to calculate the area
	-  perimeter(L, w) to calculate the perimeter
	- and print() to print the perimeter and the area which are global variables. 


Create 4 source files so that each function is written in a separate file. Perimeter= 2*(L+W), area = L*W
